/**
 * Indicates that an implementing class belongs to a fixed set that may be
 * treated
 * as an enumeration. Each instance of the class gives rise to an
 * &quot;enum-like&quot;
 * constant that can be used as a convenient representative for the underlying
 * object.
 * <p>
 * Useful in situations when a Java <code>Enum</code> cannot be used, e.g. if
 * the set of enumerated values is not known in advance and/or may change at
 * runtime.
 * <p>
 * If the enum constants are of a non-primitive type, instances of this class
 * should preferably only be obtainable from a {@link DynamicEnum} factory, to
 * reduce the risk of invalid enum values.
 * <p>
 * As enum constants, instances of the class are implicitly comparable. To
 * compare two instances <i><u>as enum constants</u></i>, use
 * {@link DynamicEnum#compare(Object, Object)}. For a <code>Comparable</code>
 * enum constant type, the results of <code>compare(e1, e2)</code> should
 * ideally match <code>e1.compareTo(e2)</code>, but this is not guaranteed.
 * 
 * @param <E>
 *            the type of the enum constants
